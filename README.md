# 538classic

A simple webpage that displays 538's publicly-available 2020 presidential election model in easy-to-read chloropleth form, with links to the 538 webpage for more information. Inspired by the way that fivethirtyeight's 2016 presidential election model was presented, this webpage formats this year's predictions in a similar fashion. The SVG code for the US map comes from https://simplemaps.com/resources/svg-us and can be freely distributed, including for commercial purposes.

Fivethirtyeight's model is scraped directly from https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/election-forecasts-2020.
